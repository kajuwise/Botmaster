Robot software written in C/C++.

Botmaster robot control platform is a flexible software framework that has been designed by EIC Robotics Club. 
It has been used for different purpose robots that competed successfully on international robotics competitions. 

Supports any 8-bit microcontrollers for controlling actuators.
Real-time video processing uses C OpenCV library.

Today, it is being maintained and enhanced as it is a soul for a robot-basketball playing robot called Neve.
